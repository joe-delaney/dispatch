## Introduction
SlackChat is a full stack clone of the popular business messaging application, Slack. Slack is a workplace communication tool that allows users to collaborate and connect with one another through a variety of ways. Slack allows for the creation of channels which are used to organize users who are related to or interested in a certain topic (i.e. budget planning). Users are able to join / leave channels, edit channel information, and send messages to all other channel members. In addition, users can directly message another user or create a private direct message group with up to 8 members in total to facilitate communication on a smaller and more direct scale than channels. As someone who uses Slack on a day-to-day basis and admired the ease of use and sleek dessign of the app, I was very interested in developing a version of it myself.
